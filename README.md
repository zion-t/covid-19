  <h2>What is COVID-19?</h2>
  <p>In <strong>December 2019</strong>, a type of <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus" target="_blank">coronavirus</a> never seen before in humans had begun to spread at Wuhan, a large city of China. Since then, the virus has spread all over the world, causing the <strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong> to declare a pandemic. Coronaviruses are a virus family that target mammals' respiratory systems. Previously, only two coronaviruses have caused global outbreaks: first being the <u>SARS(severe acute respiratory syndrome)</u> and the second being the <u>MERS(Middle East respiratory syndrome)</u>.
  </p><p style="margin-top:45px">So <u>how</u> does this virus spread? Usually, humans contract the coronavirus first due to contact with an <strong>infected animal</strong>. Although most common carriers are bats, they do not typically transmit coronaviruses to humans. The SARS coronavirus spread by civet cats while the Mers virus spread through dromedaries. The novel COVID-19 may have begun due to a seafood market in central Wuhan, but it has not been fully confirmed yet. Many other theories have also risen after the pandemic started spreading.</p>

  <h2>Data and Graph</h2>
  <p>Since the <strong>data and graph</strong> changes drastically over a short period of time, <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/" target="_blank">here</a> is the link that updates the COVID-19 case/death number every hour for each country. Also, <a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/locations.htm" target=_blank"">here</a> is a website that shows LA County's COVID-19 data by including total and daily statistics.</p>
